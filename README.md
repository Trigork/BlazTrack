# blaztrack

Web for local Blazblue Events Tracking. Built with Angular and Node.

Requires Node and Mongo installed and updated.
After cloning/pulling remember to run ``npm install``

To run the web just do ``gulp start``, that will also keep track of changes in the less and js files, so no restarting is needed.
